        Hey — I'm MADBLOX252. I create cinematic GFX, game scripting, 3D models, and animations.
        I specialise in fast, reliable scripts for Roblox, eye-catching renders for promos, and
        polished animations for in-game cutscenes and reels. I collaborate closely with clients,
        maintain clear communication, and deliver professional work tailored to each project's needs.
